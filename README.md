# Project-7---Quiz-Game
Small and basic quiz game

I created a small and basic quiz game to practice my recent knowledge of new Python functionalities, notably 2D Collections.

This quiz game is very basic but it works well and you can always add more questions to it and make it more complex !

See you in future Project 8 !
